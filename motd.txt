Hello monkes, Maple here, or FrostWH as you might know from the store.
This game is getting a revamp. I made this game for a...hobby, and I never expect over 500 downloads.
I love the small community this game has garnered. It may be small but it has a great personality.
I love you all. This revamp is gonna be better than the main game.
Coming soon.
